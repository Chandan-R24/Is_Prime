The 'Is_Prime' project, as the name suggests the project is about classifying the natural numbers into Prime and Non-Prime.
Step 01:
  The project code in the beginning, explains about the logic for considering the natural number as Prime or Non-Prime and the function for the same is written.
Step 02:
  Using pandas Machine learning library, we consider each number in the data and modifies it into dataframe , saves the dataframe in seperate .csv file in the same folder 
  and apply is_prime function to each row in the Dataframe for the range of 10,000 numbers.
Step 03:
  Visualization is drawn for total number of Prime Numbers and Non-Prime Numbers using seaborn and matplotlib libraries.
Step 04:
  Line Graph describes the cumulative count of Prime Numbers which varies linearly along the Natural numbers
Step 05:
  Total number of prime and non-primme are calculated.
Step 06:
  The gap or difference between two consecutive Prime Numbers is calculated and visualiztion represents the same.
Step 07:
  The Distribution of total Prime Numbers is divided into five parts and prime numbers in each part is highlighted with different colors.
Step 08:
  Visualization is drawn for the total number of Prime Numbers inside the natural numbers in Percentage.
Step 09:
  Implementing Random Forest Classification using input features, such as mod 2, mod 3,sum of digits,square number and whether mod of 6 is 1 or 5'
  Accuracy score of the RandomForest classification is predicted using train_test_split method.
Step 10:
  The same is done with Gradient boosting classification using the same input features and better score is predicted.
Step 11:
  The same input features are extracted for the random input from the user and model is attached with the new user input and 
  the user input natural number is classified as Prime or Non Prime based on the Gradient Boosting Classification.
